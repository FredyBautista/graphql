# `Dev Notes`

## `Future Improvements`

1.- If the App is getting bigger and handle more date maybe we can consider use Context API or Redux \
2.- Refactor the Api.js the function for create the connection to the Graphql can be placed into another method and that function can handle only the connection. \
3.- Move the queries for each endpoint into another file \
4.- Crate functions in especific for each endpoint \
5.- Handle exeptions \
6.- Consider use a library for UI such as reac-bootstrap, material design, ant desing, etc. \
